# Early Warning System - Student Attrition Prediction

## Project Overview
The Early Warning System (EWS) is a web-based application designed to leverage machine learning to predict student attrition risks and provide personalized intervention recommendations. It serves educators and academic advisors by offering insights into student engagement and performance trends, thereby improving retention rates through timely interventions.

---

## Installation
To run the Early Warning System locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox)
- Access to a web server or a local development environment that can serve HTML files.

### Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/early-warning-system.git
   cd early-warning-system
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
   You can open the file directly in any web browser or serve it using a local server. For example, using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

---

## Usage
Once you have the EWS running, you can interact with the system as follows:

1. **Dashboard:** View an overview of student attrition statistics and risk categorization.
2. **Student Risk Analysis:** Search and filter students based on risk levels and demographics.
3. **Interventions:** Access suggested interventions tailored to student risk categories.
4. **Analytics:** Review performance metrics and trends related to student engagement.

---

## Features
- **Crisis and Drift Detection:** Identify students who are at immediate risk or experiencing gradual disengagement.
- **AI Recommendations:** Get context-specific suggestions for interventions based on individual student data.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Interactive visual representation of students' risk levels and statistics.
- **Student Search & Filter:** Easily find students based on risk categories, gender, and other criteria.
- **Detailed Student Profiles:** View detailed information about each student's risk assessment and recommended actions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
/early-warning-system
├── index.html                # Main HTML file for the application
├── styles.css                # CSS styles for the application
├── data.js                   # JavaScript containing student behavior data
├── script.js                 # Main JavaScript file handling application logic
├── generate_shapash_visualizations.py  # Python script for generating SHAP visualizations
├── model_performance_visualizations.py # Python script for analyzing model performance
├── engagement_trends_visualizations.py   # Python script for engagement trends
├── simple_visualizations.py           # Python script for basic visualizations
```

### Note
Make sure you have a working environment set up if you are utilizing the Python scripts for data processing or model performance evaluations. These scripts require relevant datasets in CSV format.
